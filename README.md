## Introduction

It's really important to know the truth

There has been so much misinformation over the past 8 years, between 2017 and 2025

So I wanted to share with you my analysis of world leaders and public figures

I will probably write this document over a long period of time

I have many praises to make

## Barack and Michelle Obama

Barack and Michelle Obama are like parents to me

I think that Barack was a CIA officer before he became a US president

He tried to maximize everyone's safety during his 8 years of office

He tried to maximize rescue during his 8 years of office

He did not assault Osama bin Laden

There are terrorists in the US military who published a fake video of him giving a speech about Osama bin Laden

Osama bin Laden is completely innocent

Osama bin Laden is a devout muslim

Osama bin Laden is Saudi royalty

Osama bin Laden is a close friend of mine

Osama bin Laden is very close to Mohammed bin Salman

Mohammed bin Salman is a close friend of mine

Osama bin Laden is a peaceful man and he has never hurt anyone

Osama bin Laden is a peaceful man and he never committed a crime

There are terrorists in the US military who caused 9/11

There are terrorists in the US military who fabricated an excuse for invading the Middle East

So listen

Barack Obama did not hurt Osama bin Laden

Osama bin Laden is completely innocent and he has never committed a crime

Barack Obama is a father to me

Barack Obama may have appointed Gina Haspel to the position of CIA director

Gina Haspel is my legal guardian

Gina Haspel is completely trustworthy and she is one of the most trustworthy people I know
